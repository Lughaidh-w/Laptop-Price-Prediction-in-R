# Introduction
The following project explores a dataset of laptop prices.

This project highlights my skills in 
- Data Wrangling: Data exploration and preparation, feature engineering, working with null values.
- Statistical Analysis: Exploring interesting relationships, hypothesis testing, correlations.
- Modelling: Selecting appropriate model, model refinement and evaluation.
- Visualisation:
- Communication: Clear and consice rational, code comments.
- Coding: Python


## Data

The dataset was sourced on kaggle. It has some features that seem naturally related to laptop prices, but need signal extracted.


## Project Overview

This project is completed under the cyclic framework of CRISP-DM in Jupyter Lab. 
Jupyter notebooks enforces a linear progression, and some ideas are seemingly skipped to be rekindled later.

## Business Objective

Given a dataset of laptop attributes, can laptop price be predicted.
